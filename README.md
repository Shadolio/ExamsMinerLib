# Exams Miner
Provide students, teachers and developers software to download past exam papers, their marking schemes and so on, easier and faster.

We are having an initiative to setup a nice friendly and helpful README file to all users who might land here. You can read more about what we wish to have here in the issue at "https://github.com/Shadolio/ExamsMinerLib/issues/1".
